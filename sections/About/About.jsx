            I have a bachelor&apos;s degree in Computer Systems Engineering from
            the Universidad de las Am√©ricas Puebla, and I am passionate about
            technology and design. I have experience developing different types
            of applications, and I like to create solutions that captivate
            users.

            Currently, I am in the Apple Developer Academy program where I work
            with different teams to develop applications for the Apple
            ecosystem. We focus on learning and applying the latest iOS
            development technologies with SwiftUI, focusing on user experience
            and accessibility.
